# odin-recipes
This is a toy HTML5 project which teaches people the beginnings of web development.

I hope to make plenty of mistakes with this projects. Humans typically keep lessons after a mistake rather than a success. This should lead to plenty of oppurtunities for research.

The goal of this project is to build a web page(s) that contain a series of goofball recipes.
