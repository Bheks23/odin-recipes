This is a toy HTML5 project which teaches people the beginnings of web development.

I hope to make plenty of mistakes with this projects. Humans typically keep lessons after a mistake rather than a success. This should lead to plenty of oppurtunities for research.

The goal of this project is to build a web page(s) that contain a series of goofball recipes.

And we are done! Nice short and simple project. The website looks incredibly gross but it works. I am excited to learn more. I feel a lot more comfortable in using Git and Github. I can see why this tool is so powerful. HTML feels as if it's a tad tedious to write.
