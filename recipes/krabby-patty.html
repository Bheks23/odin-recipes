            <li>One large onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>Two cloves of garlic, minced</li>
            <li>One teaspoon of salt</li>
            <li>Half a teaspoon of black pepper</li>
            <li>One cup of bread crumbs</li>
            <li>Two eggs</li>
            <li>One tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>One tablespoon of mustard</li>
            <li>Eight hamburger buns</li>
            <li>Four tablespoons of butter</li>
            <li>Lettuce leaves</li>
            <li>Sliced tomatoes</li>
            <li>Sliced pickles</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground beef, chopped onion,
                minced garlic, salt, black pepper, bread crumbs, eggs,
                Worcestershire sauce, and mustard. Mix well.</li>
            <li>Divide the mixture into eight portions and shape each portion
                into a patty that is about three-quarters of an inch thick.</li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Melt two tablespoons
                of butter in the skillet.</li>
            <li>Add the patties to the skillet and cook for four to five minutes
                on each side, or until they are browned and cooked through.</li>
            <li>Remove the patties from the skillet and set them aside.</li>
            <li>Wipe the skillet clean and return it to the stove. Melt the
                remaining two tablespoons of butter in the skillet.</li>
            <li>Toast the hamburger buns in the skillet until they are golden
                brown.</li>
            <li>Assemble the Krabby Patties by placing a lettuce leaf, a tomato
                slice, and a pickle slice on the bottom half of each toasted
                bun. Top each with a cooked patty, and then add the top half of
                the bun.</li>
            <li>Serve the Krabby Patties immediately, with additional toppings
                as desired.</li>
        </ol>
