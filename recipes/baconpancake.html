        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>It's in the name. A breakfast for champions. A favorite dish for a
            certain animated magical dog.
            A perfect blend of sweet and sour.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Two eggs</li>
            <li>One cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>One teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>
            <li>Two tablespoons sugar</li>
            <li>Two teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>One cup milk</li>
            <li>Six strips of bacon, cooked and crumbled</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder,
                and salt.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, and vegetable
                oil.</li>
            <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until
                just combined. Be careful not to overmix the batter, as this can
                result in tough pancakes.</li>
            <li>Gently fold in the crumbled bacon.</li>
            <li>Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Grease the
                surface with cooking spray or butter.</li>
            <li>Using a 1/4 cup measure, pour the batter onto the skillet,
                leaving some space between each pancake.</li>
            <li>Cook the pancakes until the surface starts to bubble and the
                edges start to look dry, then flip them over and cook for
                another minute or two, until both sides are golden brown.</li>
            <li>Serve the bacon pancakes hot with maple syrup or your favorite
                toppings.</li>
        </ol>
