    <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>This is the Man Smoothie. It is a quite refreshing beverage that'll put hair on your chest.
             Best served with a side of Marlboro Reds or a pinch of Coppenhagen Wintergreen.
             You will need a V8 engine blender but a more common Miata engine blender will work</p>
             
             <h2>Ingredients</h2>
             <ul>
                <li>A T-bone steak with the bone</li>
                <li>A bottle of tobasco sauce</li>
                <li>One clay brick</li>
                <li>Two bottles of Washyoursistersauce</li>
                <li>Bovril, however much you'd like</li>
             </ul>

             <h2>Steps</h2>
             <ol>
                <li>Add all the ingredients to the blender, no ingredient prep neccesary</li>
                <li>Blend between 6000 and 7000 RPM. If using a smaller engine,
                     you will need to double blend time by double for every two cylinders less than a V8</li>
                <li>Pour into pint glass and enjoy</li>
             </ol>
