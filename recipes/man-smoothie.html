    <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>This is the Man Smoothie. It is a quite refreshing beverage that'll put hair on your chest.
             Best served with a side of Marlboro Reds or a pinch of Coppenhagen Wintergreen.
             You will need a V8 engine blender but a more common Miata engine blender will work</p>
